<p>Services are billed on at hourly rate. </p>

<p>Initial evaluation (55min)  $160.00</p>

<p>Psychotherapy 	(55min)  $150.00</p>

<p>Private pay psychotherapy (55min)  $120.00</p>

<p>Insurance: Psychotherapy may be covered by your medical insurance if it is deemed "medically necessary."  What this means is that if you are evaluated and meet the criteria for a mental health diagnosis (ie: Anxiety, Depression) your psychotherapy is considered treatment and therefore covered by your medical insurance.  I will complete this evaluation which will involve a clinical diagnosis.  I will bill your medical insurance directly.  You will be responsible for co-pay and deductible payments.  I am in network with the following insurance companies: BCBS, Moda, Cigna, Pacific Source, Aetna, Medicare, First Choice.  All other insurers would be billed as out of network.</p>

<p>HSA (Health Savings Accounts): Often with high deductible medical insurance plans you may have an HSA.  I encourage you to take some time to understand the benefits of this type of plan by visiting <a href="http://www.hsacenter.com/what-is-an-hsa/qualified-medical-expenses/">HSACenter.com</a>.  These accounts can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses including some not covered by your medical insurance. They can be used for co-pay, deductible or out of network expenses. They can also be used for services that are necessary to prevent a mental illness if provided by a mental health professional.  This might include a level of distress or disturbance that does not meet the criteria for a medical insurance eligible diagnosis but should be addressed to alleviate the problem and not further compromise your mental health. </p>

<p>Private Pay: If you are seeking assistance and are not impaired by a mental health condition you will be paying privately. These types of situations might include: parenting support, career development or life transitions with limited symptoms or pre-marital counseling.  </p>

<p>Couple's Counseling: If you are seeking couple's counseling it is likely not appropriate to bill your medical insurance.  These services may be eligible  HSA expenses.  If one or both individuals in the couple have a level of distress and disturbance a mental health professional may consider therapy necessary to prevent a mental health illness and would therefore qualify for an eligible HSA expense.</p>

<p>I accept cash, checks, and PayPal, but no credit cards. </p>
