<p>Perhaps you've never seen a therapist before or your past experiences were disappointing.  It might be helpful to know what to expect.  We will initially talk on the phone.  I will ask you a few questions to assess whether we are likely to be a good fit.  I will answer any questions you have about me or the work.  If we both agree, we'll set up an initial appointment.  That session will last 55 minutes.</p>

<p>At this initial appointment I will ask a lot of questions.  I will also be available to answer questions you might have.  I will share with you my observations and how our work might proceed.  By the end of the initial session, most people are fairly clear about whether they believe this process will be helpful.</p>

<p>Typically I see people once a week.  In some cases I might see someone more that once a week.  Some times issues are resolved quickly.  Other times we might uncover more complex issues which involve longer term work to address.  The length of our work will be something we look at together.</p>

<p>Psychotherapy is a collaborative process.   We will work together to insure you fully benefit from this experience.</p>
